        <h1>Different Types of Labs</h1>
        <p>There are many types of labs in the world. Most labs you usually see and the the ones I am going to be talking about are yellow, chocolate, and black labs. That just discribes the color of them, these labs are in 2 different breeds. There is the American lab and the English lab which are usually bigger than the American lab.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Black lab</li>
            <li>Yellow lab</li>
            <li>Chocolate lab</li>

        </ul>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>English</th>
                <th>American</th>
                
            </tr>
            <tr>
                
                <td>block head</td>
                <td>narrow head</td>
                  
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>straight tail</td>
                <td>curved tail</td>
                
            </tr>
            <td>dense body</td>
            <td>lanky body</td>
            <tr>

            </tr>


        </table>

        <p>Both of these types of labs my great service and hunting dogs. Lab service dogs are typically used to find people and drugs. Lab hunting dogs are usually use to retrieve ducks and other birds for their owners. If you just want a lab as a pet, that is great too, because they make great family dogs. </p>
